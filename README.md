  message that how beautiful can be for a
  country to welcome every nation.

  →Data Examination: Examine the data
  and choose 3 of them for the period

  data by creating other xlsx files by re-
  organizing the columns and rows . Also,
  added new columns like geometry object.
  No filter applied as data is sensitive.

  → Angle: Questions that my charts
  should answer are:
  -How many immigrants are in the US ?
  - Where are the immigrants from ?
  - Why to move in US ?
  - Where do immigrants live in US ?

  → Framing: Taking the decisions what
  data to include and exclude in each
  graph. 

  → Focus: Asked myself in every
  design decision I took if that was the
  feature I want to emphasized
